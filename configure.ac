AC_PREREQ(2.69)

dnl let's bump the version to x.x.x-dev while working on the devel
dnl branch, so who ever uses it and/or run 'make dist' or 'make
dnl distcheck' are aware it is a wip version.

dnl Use `serial-tests' so the output `check-guile' is not hidden

dnl `serial-tests' was introduced in Automake 1.12.

dnl although no change has been made to any module, we bumped the
dnl dependency version to 2.0.12 [or higher], because it has texinfo
